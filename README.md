# Play Words
Programs to extract words from a dictionary and to play with these words

This project was made for the Programming Curricular Unit (1st year of Integrated Master Degree in Computer Engineering - FEUP) and was not evaluated.

The first program probably only works with the dictionary 29765-8.txt, because he has some restrict rules to search for the words.
The second program is also made for a dictionary resulting from the first program.
